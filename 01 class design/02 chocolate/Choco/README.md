# Chocolate Factory Management
Practice Concepts: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Overriding

1. Create a base class Chocolate with properties like Flavor, Weight, and CocoaPercentage.
2. Add derived classes like DarkChocolate, MilkChocolate, and WhiteChocolate.
3. Override a method GetDescription() to provide details specific to each type of chocolate.
4. Use encapsulation to validate properties (e.g., CocoaPercentage must be between 0 and 100).
5. Add a method CalculateCalories() in the base class and override it in derived classes to factor in unique ingredients.
