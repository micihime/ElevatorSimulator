# Elevator Simulator

This repository contains an elevator simulation implemented in C#. The simulation models an elevator's basic operations, including moving between floors, handling people entering and exiting, and displaying its current status.

## Features

- Floor Navigation: Move between specified floors while respecting minimum and maximum floor constraints.
- Capacity Management: Restrict the number of people inside the elevator based on a defined capacity.
- Status Display: Show the current floor and number of people inside the elevator.
- Default Positioning: Return the elevator to the default floor (ground floor).
- Error Handling: Handle cases such as exceeding capacity or invalid floor requests gracefully.
