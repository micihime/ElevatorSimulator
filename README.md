# C# Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing and deepening my understanding of various C# concepts through simple console applications. Each folder focuses on a specific topic and contains exercises designed for hands-on learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a different C# topic:

### 1. `01 Class Design`
In this folder, I will focus on designing and implementing classes while practicing the following concepts:

- **Inheritance**: Understanding how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring that class data is hidden and accessible only through well-defined interfaces.
- **Overriding**: Customizing behavior in derived classes by overriding methods from base classes.
- **Abstract Classes**: Exploring how abstract classes provide a blueprint for derived classes.
- **Interfaces**: Learning how interfaces define contracts that classes can implement.

Each exercise will be a standalone console application, demonstrating these principles in action.

### 2. `02 Delegates`
This folder is dedicated to practicing the concept of delegates, focusing on:

- **Basic Delegate Syntax**: Defining and using delegates.
- **Multicast Delegates**: Combining multiple methods into a single delegate.
- **Anonymous Methods**: Using inline methods with delegates.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Simplifying delegate syntax with lambdas.
- **Event Handling**: Implementing event-driven programming using delegates.

Like the first folder, each exercise will be implemented as a simple console application.

### Future Topics
More topics will be added to the repository over time as I continue to learn. Possible topics include:

- LINQ
- Asynchronous programming (async/await)
- Collections and generics
- File I/O
- Design patterns in C#

## How to Run the Exercises

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csharp-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `01 Class Design` or `02 Delegates`).

3. Open the corresponding solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

4. Build and run the console application to see the output.
